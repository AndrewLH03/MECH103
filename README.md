## Description
**This repository contains algorithms, scripts, and other useful files that I created and/or implemented as part of the coursework for MECH105: Introduction to MATLAB. The algorithms and scripts cover a range of topics including root-find methods, numerical integration and differentiation, and LU decomposition to solve systems of equations.**

## Algorithms
**The following algorithms are currently included in this repository:**

- Bisection Method: A numerical method for finding roots of a function within a given interval.
- False Position Method: A numerical method for finding roots of a function within a given interval.
- Newton-Raphson Method: A numerical method for finding roots of a function.
- LU Factorization: A method for solving a system of linear equations using LU factorization.
- Gaussian Elimination: A method for solving a system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination.
- Trapezoidal Rule: A numerical method for approximating the definite integral of a function.
- Simpson's 1/3 Rule: A numerical method for approximating the definite integral of a function.

## Homework
**Includes all files used as a part of completing homework assignments during this course**

*Includes:*
- Linear Regression
- Open Methods
- Taylor Series
- Gauss Quadrature
- Computer Memory

## In-Class
**During the length of this class, we used scripts, some developed by Dr. Bechara, and some developed by me, to complete problems in class**

*Includes:*
- Plotting an Ellipse
- Linear Regression Model of Covid
- Tanara's Problem
- Tensile Strength
- Trapezoidal Rule
- Van Der Waals Equation

## Other
**As well as everything else already highlighted, there are some scattered documents used for studying for finals, for example, and other collections of useful material developed for this class**

## Getting Started
**To use any of the algorithms in this repository, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. Once you have MATLAB installed, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine. From there, you can navigate to the folder containing the algorithm you are interested in and run the script in MATLAB.**
