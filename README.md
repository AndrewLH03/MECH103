## Getting Started
**To use any of the algorithms in this repository, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. Once you have MATLAB installed, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine. From there, you can navigate to the folder containing the algorithm you are interested in and run the script in MATLAB.**
